        <h3 id="description">College students spend a surprising share of their income on food—over 25% on average,
           as shown in the pie chart above—while thousands of meals go to waste every day. With
            students shelling out around $1,000 per semester just to eat, food costs quickly add
             up during their college career, leaving less room for essentials like rent, tuition,
              and savings for after graduation. At the same time, restaurants, grocery stores,
               and campus events regularly have surplus food, with nearly 29 servings wasted per
                gathering in urban and suburban areas. That’s almost 1000 perfectly good servings
                 of food being thrown away while students stretch their budgets to afford their next
                  meal. By connecting hungry Longhorns with these extra meals, we can reduce food waste,
                   help students save money, and make sure no meal goes uneaten.</h3>

                available for pickup. After that, just wait for students to arrive to take food that is
                 extra or near expiring off your hands!</h3>
